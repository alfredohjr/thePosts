# ThePosts

Here you can find about what i learned and what i am learning.

I am always experimenting with new technologies, often doing the same thing in various languagesâ€”it's a habit I cultivate. That's why you'll often find topics here that seem a bit out of context. It's my way of pushing my creativity and gaining experience. Additionally, subjects related to economics, biology, politics, and philosophy are areas I delve into to broaden my horizons. Studying all of this in an alternating manner helps me piece together complex puzzles, sometimes unfortunately seeming senseless, but at least tested in my mind. Finally, I have the habit of writing, which helps me absorb all the subjects I enjoy and want to learn.
